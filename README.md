Arecibo Message Visualization
This project visualizes the Arecibo message, a binary-coded message sent into space as an attempt to communicate with extraterrestrial intelligence. The visualization includes interactive features such as zooming, panning, section highlighting, and animation of the drawing process.

The Arecibo message consists of 1,679 binary digits (0s and 1s). The number 1,679 is a semiprime (a product of two prime numbers), 23 and 73. This allows the message to be arranged into a 23 by 73 grid. The message includes information about numbers, elements, DNA, a human figure, the Solar System, and the Arecibo telescope.

Features:
- Zoom and Pan: Allows users to zoom in and out of the canvas and pan around to explore the message.
- Section Highlighting: Highlights different sections of the message as users hover over the explanation list.
- Animation: Animates the drawing process to make it more engaging.

Prerequisites:
A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.)
